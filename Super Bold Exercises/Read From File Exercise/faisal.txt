Was it the one we did online in early september?
I barely remember it That was like over a month ago, how am I supposed to remember it?
What did we even do? I think it was a typical abcd exam
I think like 4 or 5 people failed the initial test and then 2 people flunked the second attempt.
How did they even fail it, it was literally just google and ctrl+f
smh
